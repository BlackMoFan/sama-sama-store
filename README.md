Sama-sama Store is a startup online shopping platform created by students from West Visayas State University - College of ICT and Central Philippine University.
It is dedicated to help students and people to connect with products and services that can help them primarily with their educational needs.
Additionally, it aims to help students and anyone who wishes to gain extra income by selling their materials and services in this platform.


This project is dedicated to a non-profit student organization called SAndigan ng mga MAg-aaral para sa SAmbayanan (SAMASA) in West Visayas State University.
This organization upholds peoples rights and welfare. So the money that will be raised in this project will go to the developers and the organization.
